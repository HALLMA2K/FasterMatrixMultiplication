# FasterMatrixMultiplication

Matrices hold a significant place in both mathematics and computer science, but their impact extends far beyond academia. They play a crucial role in managing and storing digital data in our everyday lives. The multiplication of matrices is fundamental in areas such as graph theory and practical fields like computer graphics and digital signal processing (DSP). In fact, matrix operations are the backbone of DSP chips, which can be found in every cell phone and digital camera, enabling the digitization and electronic storage or transmission of sounds and images. Furthermore, matrix multiplication plays a key role in many machine learning algorithms, which rely on the manipulation of large datasets in order to make predictions and identify patterns. By representing these datasets as matrices and performing matrix operations on them, machine learning algorithms can quickly and efficiently identify complex relationships and make accurate predictions. Matrices are also an excellent example of an area where optimizing code can have a significant impact on performance. By learning to work with matrices more efficiently, you will be able to write faster and more effective code in a variety of applications, from graph theory to DSP. Additionally, mastering matrix operations will allow you to better understand the fundamental principles behind some of the technologies we use every day.
